# Phanthy Motus

[中文文档](README_zh.md) | [Official Website](https://motus.phanthy.com)

**Give Embodied AI a Real Soul.** PhanthyMotus is a next-generation, open-source framework and platform for Embodied AI Agents. Built upon a robust ROS2 foundation, it seamlessly bridges diverse sensor inputs with advanced robot execution. By enabling flexible integration of World Models, LLMs, and VLMs, PhanthyMotus transforms traditional hardware into soulful, intelligent assistants capable of perceiving, thinking, and acting independently in the real world.

## Quick Start

Install and run with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://motus.phanthy.com/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Or specify a version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://motus.phanthy.com/install.sh | sudo bash -s <tag>
```

The install script will automatically install Docker (if needed), pull the latest Agent Core image, and start the service.

Open `http://<device-ip>:15678` to access the Web Dashboard.

Browse available versions and images at the [Resource Center](https://motus.phanthy.com).

### Connect Hardware

Deploy hardware drivers from **[phanthymotus-driver](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver)**. Drivers automatically register with Agent Core on startup — no manual configuration needed.

### Build from Source

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for building and running from source code.

## Features

- **Visual Orchestration** — Drag-and-drop web dashboard for connecting devices, sensors, and AI models on a canvas
- **MCP Data Bus** — Unified [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) interface for all hardware devices
- **Driver-Inferred Topics** — Output ROS2 topics are declared by drivers, not computed by the core. The canvas calls each driver's `info` action (passing `instance_id` for sensors or `input_topic` for processors) to get the exact topic path before the device starts, keeping all topic naming logic inside the driver
- **Event-Driven Agent Loop** — LLM-powered reasoning with multi-turn tool calling, driven by real-time sensor events
- **ROS2 Integration** — Native DDS bridge for seamless ROS2 topic relay and monitoring
- **Pluggable Perception** — Modular ASR/TTS stack with multi-instance support and local inference (Jetson)
- **Web Dashboard** — Real-time device monitoring, agent activity stream, and configuration — all from the browser

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/images/architecture.png)

> Editable source: [`docs/architecture.svg`](docs/architecture.svg) — re-export the PNG after changing it.

The platform runs a single **sense → think → act** loop:

`Hardware → Driver·Sensor → Perception → Agent Loop → ActuCore → Driver·Actuator → Hardware`

- **Drivers (L1)** — One MCP server per device. Every tool declares a `type`, and the Agent Core treats each type differently: `sensor` (data streams), `actuator` (executable actions), `processor` (data transforms), `resource` (static assets such as URDF). Sensor and actuator tools normally live in the **same** driver process — the diagram splits them by direction of data flow, not by deployment.
- **Perception (L2, ports 15720 / 15721)** — Turns raw streams into semantics: ASR, TTS, VLM captions, vision understanding, face recognition.
- **ActuCore (L2, port 15730)** — The execution-model side of the same layer, shipped in this repository as [`actucore/`](actucore/): VLA policies, navigation, grasping, locomotion, whole-body control. It is a card host, structurally identical to Perception — each execution model attaches as a `processor` card, so any model that takes a goal and emits motion commands plugs in the same way. **It currently ships no cards**; the models are chosen per robot. See [`actucore/README.md`](actucore/README.md) for the card contract.
- **Agent Loop (L3, port 15678)** — FastAPI + `ros2_bridge.py`: event collector, layered L1–L4 prompt, tool dispatch, ACP barrier, history compaction, steering / interrupt, task store, subagent manager, skills, memory.
- **Two bypass lanes** — The loop can call `sensor` tools directly, skipping perception; and it can drive `actuator` tools over MCP JSON-RPC directly, skipping ActuCore. Both are the common path for simple queries and one-shot commands.
- **Web Dashboard** — Subscribes to every DDS topic on the bus via `/ws/bus/{topic}`, and to the agent's decision stream via `/ws/motus`.

Hardware drivers are maintained in a separate repository: **[phanthymotus-driver](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver)**.

### Memory & Long-Running Agent Architecture

The Agent Core is designed for **continuous operation over days or months**. The architecture separates real-time interaction from background intelligence:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Main Agent Loop                     │
│  • Only processes user interactions (ASR/message)    │
│  • Lean history → stable prefix caching (~90% hit)   │
│  • Uses memory_recall for on-demand context retrieval│
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────┘
               │ spawn                │ memory_recall
               ▼                      ▼
┌──────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────────┐
│   User Task Subagent │   │    Memory Store (SQLite)  │
│  • Isolated context  │   │  • subagent_conclusions   │
│  • Full tool access  │   │  • chat_history (FTS5)    │
│  • Returns summary   │   │  • daily_summary          │
└──────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────────┘
               ▲
┌──────────────────────┐
│    BG Monitor Agent   │
│  • Sensor analysis   │
│  • Results → DB only │
│  • urgent=true → push│
└──────────────────────┘
```

**Key design principles:**

- **Main agent stays lean** — only user interactions enter the conversation history. Background monitoring conclusions are stored in the memory database, not pushed to the main thread.
- **Memory recall on demand** — `memory_recall` tool provides FTS-based retrieval from past conversations, subagent conclusions, and daily summaries. Both main agent and subagents can use it.
- **Urgent interrupts only** — background subagents only interrupt the main agent for safety-critical alerts (battery critical, hardware faults). Routine reports go to the database silently.
- **Daily auto-summary** — a scheduled subagent generates daily reports covering user interactions, task completion, anomalies, performance review, and skill discovery opportunities.
- **Prefix caching optimized** — stable system prompt (L1 + L2-static) is frozen per turn; dynamic status is minimal and placed in user messages to maximize LLM prefix cache hits.

## Web Dashboard

The dashboard at `http://<device-ip>:15678` provides:

### Canvas — Visual Orchestration

Add sensors and actuators you need onto the canvas, connect them to the core Agent Loop, and the framework handles data flow and execution automatically. Build your embodied AI agent like stacking building blocks.

![Canvas](docs/images/home.png)

### Real-Time Monitoring

Live sensor data visualization — audio waveforms, battery status, 3D skeleton/point cloud, and more.

![Monitoring Dashboard](docs/images/dashboard.png)

#### Derived topics

A `multiInstance` tool (ASR, TTS, OCR) does not have a fixed output topic. The
driver infers it from the input topic the card is connected to —
`/remote_control/mic` + `asr` → `/remote_control/mic/asr` — so the same tool on two
cards publishes to two different topics, and a card's topic only exists once
something has asked the driver (`action: info` with `input_topic`, a read).

Two rules follow, both of which were learned the hard way:

- **A derived topic is only valid for the input it was derived from.** The canvas
  records which input produced each answer and refetches when the graph changes
  underneath it (`_revalidateDerivedTopics` in `web/js/canvas.js`). Without that,
  re-pointing a TTS card from one source to another left it publishing to the old
  source's topic: the dashboard panel watched a topic nothing fed, and there was no
  sound.
- **The saved layout is not a source of truth for them.** The monitor dashboard
  resolves them itself (`web/js/topic-derive.js`), rather than depending on someone
  having had the canvas page open — which is why the ASR panel used not to be there
  until you visited the canvas.

Frontend tests: `node --test "agent-core/web/js/*.test.mjs"` (no dependencies).

### Agent Definition

Define the agent's identity, system prompt, and long-term memory directly from the UI.

![Agent Definition](docs/images/agent-definition.png)

### History Logs

Browse past agent sessions with full event traces and tool call results.

![History Logs](docs/images/history.png)

### Skill Management

A community-driven Skill Marketplace where users share and discover skills. Browse and install skills contributed by others, or teach your robot new capabilities using natural language — no coding required.

![Skills](docs/images/skills.png)

### Solutions — Package & Load a Whole Setup

Open **Solutions** from the top-left of the dashboard. A solution bundles everything
that makes one robot work — canvas topology and per-card config, active skills,
prompt files, and tasks — into one shareable package on the Resource Center
marketplace.

- **Save**: pick which blocks to package. The canvas is mandatory; skills, each of
  the three prompt files, and tasks are optional. Only skills that are already
  published on the Skill Marketplace can be packaged, so recipients can actually
  install them.
- **Load**: Agent Core first checks that every required driver / perception /
  actucore image is installed (offering one-click install for images already in
  the local catalog), then lists exactly what will be overwritten before applying.
- **Align versions** (optional): tick it and each involved container is redeployed
  at the image tag recorded in the package before the solution is applied — only
  the tag is taken, the local registry is kept. Agent Core itself is never
  auto-aligned, since restarting it would abort the load; the dashboard shows the
  recorded core version so you can upgrade manually if needed.
- **Secrets stay home**: fields a tool declares sensitive (`format: password` or
  `x-sensitive: true` in its `configSchema`) are blanked during packaging and
  reported to the loading user as "needs configuration".

Cards reference devices by MCP `server_name`, not by the machine-local
`mcp-<timestamp>` id, so a package loads onto a different robot of the same model.

### Service Deployment

Deploy and manage Agent Core and hardware driver containers from the dashboard.

![Deploy](docs/images/deploy.png)

## Deployment Architecture

All services run as Docker containers managed by a single `docker-compose.yml` at `/opt/phanthy-motus/` on the target device.

### How it works

1. **Install**: The `install.sh` script pulls the Agent Core image, extracts the initial `docker-compose.yml` from the image, and starts the service
2. **Add drivers**: When you deploy a driver via the Web Dashboard, Agent Core pulls the driver image, extracts its `deploy/service.yml` fragment, and merges it into the compose file
3. **Unified orchestration**: All containers (core, drivers, perception, actucore) are managed by the same compose file with `docker compose up -d`

### Container privileges

All driver, perception and actucore containers run with `privileged: true` and `/dev:/dev` mounted to access hardware devices (cameras, USB, GPIO). Network is set to `host` mode for ROS2 DDS communication.

```yaml
# Example: how a deployed service looks in /opt/phanthy-motus/docker-compose.yml
services:
  agent-core:
    image: registry/core:tag
    network_mode: host
    ipc: host
    pid: host
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /dev:/dev
      - /opt/phanthy-motus/data:/work/resource
    ...
  unitree-g1:
    image: registry/drivers/unitree/g1:tag
    network_mode: host
    ipc: host
    pid: host
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /dev:/dev
    ...
```

## Ports

| Service | Port |
|---------|------|
| Agent Core | 15678 |
| Perception MCP | 15720 |
| Perception WebSocket | 15721 |
| ActuCore MCP | 15730 |
| PR Review Agent (optional) | 25000 |

Hardware driver ports are documented in [phanthymotus-driver](https://github.com/4paradigm/phanthymotus-driver).

## Container Logs

Every container declares log rotation in its `deploy/service.yml` (or compose
fragment): the `local` driver, `max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 3` — so ~30 MB per
container, compressed. Agent Core injects that same policy as a default when a
driver image's fragment omits it.

### Do not truncate a live container's log file

**`truncate -s 0` on `/var/lib/docker/containers/<id>/**/*.log` corrupts the
log.** The file size is reset but the Docker daemon keeps its write offset, so
the next write lands past the new end-of-file and the kernel fills the gap with
NUL bytes. `docker logs` then fails outright:

```
Error grabbing logs: invalid character '\x00' looking for beginning of value   # json-file
Error grabbing logs: error unmarshalling log entry: proto: illegal tag 0       # local
```

Once that happens the log is unreadable until the file is replaced. A
`truncate_log.sh` helper used to live in `deploy/` and was removed for exactly
this reason.

### What to do instead

| Goal | Command |
|------|---------|
| Read recent logs | `docker logs --tail 500 -f <container>` |
| Reclaim log space now | `docker restart <container>` — the daemon reopens and rotates its writer cleanly |
| Reclaim disk generally | `docker image prune -a --filter until=168h` (stale images usually dwarf logs) |
| Check log size | `du -sh /var/lib/docker/containers/*/local-logs` |

### Host baseline (recommended, not applied automatically)

Containers started outside the compose/service.yml paths inherit the daemon
default, which for `json-file` is unbounded. Set a floor in
`/etc/docker/daemon.json` so nothing can escape rotation:

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": { "max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3" }
}
```

Applying this requires restarting the Docker daemon, which stops every container
on the host — schedule it rather than doing it mid-session.

## Resource Center (Optional)

The platform can optionally connect to a [Resource Center](https://motus.phanthy.com) for:
- Browsing and deploying pre-built driver/perception images
- Managing skills and extensions
- Publishing and installing solutions (canvas + skills + prompt + tasks bundles)
- OTA updates

Configure via the `RESOURCE_CENTER_URL` environment variable.

## System Hooks

System hooks provide **instant, bypass-LLM actions** for time-critical responses. Drivers declare hook bindings via `x-hooks` in their MCP tool schema; Agent Core fires them directly on system events without waiting for LLM or ACP barrier.

### Architecture

```
System Event (ASR arrives / LLM starts / error)
  → Agent Core hooks.fire("on_thinking")
  → call_tool_direct() to driver (bypasses barrier + ACP)
  → Driver executes immediately (LED effect, interrupt, etc.)
```

### Available Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `on_hearing` | Voice activity detected | LED blink blue |
| `on_kws_wakeup` | Wake word detected | LED solid blue 2s |
| `on_kws_interrupt` | `kws_interrupt` wake word detected | Stop TTS + speaker, keep motion running |
| `on_kws_interrupt_timeout` | No usable command in the interrupt window | Ask Core to continue the prior action |
| `on_thinking` | LLM inference starts | LED rainbow breathe |
| `on_error` | LLM failure | LED red flash 5s |
| `on_interrupt_all` | User barge-in | Stop TTS + motion |

### API

```bash
POST /api/hooks/fire  {"hook": "on_interrupt_all"}
GET  /api/hooks       # list all registered hooks
```
